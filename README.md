**dotfiles** _new machines the way I like them_

My dotfiles and "new machine" setup, uses [chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi).

### What does it do
Sets up my home directory with dotfiles and installs everything a new machine needs to be used by me, including:

- oh-my-zsh
- vim plugins
- spaceship shell
- nvm (for managing node versions)
- chruby ans ruby-install (for managing ruby versions)
- pyenv (for managing python versions)
